SimpleCensor is an automated censorship suite featuring a Gradio WebUI for batch processing images and videos with a manual refinement tool, alongside a Live Screen Overlay for real-time AI-powered desktop censorship. It utilizes YOLO models to identify and mask specific classes to censor sensitive material.Installation and SetupTo use the software, you must follow these steps:Run setup.bat: This is the most critical step. This batch file automates the entire installation process. It creates a portable Python environment, sets up a virtual environment with the necessary GPU-accelerated libraries for NVIDIA RTX cards, and downloads the required AI models from the Hugging Face repository.Launch the Application: Once the setup is complete, you can use the other provided batch files to start the specific module you need.Module DescriptionsLive Desktop Overlay (desktop.py)This module provides real-time censorship of your desktop environment. It is launched via run_desktop.bat.Dual-Pass Detection: It uses a global pass to maintain stability across the whole screen and a tiled pass to catch small details or thumbnails that the global pass might miss.Momentum Prediction: The code calculates the velocity and acceleration of moving objects on your screen. This allows the censor box to "lead" the movement, ensuring sensitive areas remain covered even during fast scrolling or movement.Interactive Configuration: When started, the script will look for a preferences.json file. If it is not found or if you choose to create new ones, it will prompt you for:Performance Settings: You can define the update delay, smoothing factor, and max missing frames to balance speed and visual fluidness.Censor Criteria: You will be asked a series of yes/no questions for 18 different categories (such as exposed genitalia, breasts, or buttocks) to determine exactly what the AI should target.Gradio WebUI (webui.py)This module provides a browser-based interface for processing static files. It is launched via run_webui.bat.Batch Processing: This tool is designed to handle multiple images and videos at once, applying censorship masks automatically based on the trained YOLO models.Manual Refinement: It includes a manual tool that allows users to review the AI's work and refine the masks, ensuring 100% accuracy for sensitive exports.Recommended SettingsFor users with an NVIDIA RTX 4060, the following settings in the preferences.json are recommended for the best balance of speed and coverage:SettingRecommended ValueDescriptionGlobal Sensitivity40%The confidence threshold for the full-screen scan.Tiled Sensitivity25%The confidence threshold for the high-detail tiled scans.Update Delay1msHow often the UI refreshes.Smoothing Factor0.5Controls the fluidness of the box movement; 0.5 provides a natural drift.Max Missing Frames10How long a box stays visible if the AI loses the target (prevents flickering).Technical RequirementsOperating System: Windows 10 or 11.Hardware: An NVIDIA GPU (RTX 30-series or 40-series recommended) is required for the real-time overlay to function smoothly.Drivers: Ensure you have up-to-date NVIDIA drivers installed to support CUDA and ONNX GPU acceleration.Would you like me to add a section on how to update the models if a new version is released on Hugging Face?
